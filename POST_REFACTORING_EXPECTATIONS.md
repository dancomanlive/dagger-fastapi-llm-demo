# Post-Refactoring System Behavior & Expectations

## 🎯 What Should Happen Now

Now that the refactoring from HTTP-based service calls to Temporal workflow orchestration is **complete**, here's what we can expect:

## 🚀 Expected System Architecture

### **Before Refactoring (Old HTTP-based)**
```
User → Gradio UI → HTTP calls → FastAPI → HTTP calls → Retriever/Embedding Services
```

### **After Refactoring (New Temporal-based)**
```
User → Gradio UI → Temporal Client → Temporal Server → Workflow Orchestration
                                         ↓
                    Embedding Service ← Activities → Retriever Service
                         ↓                              ↓
                    Vector Embeddings              Vector Search
                         ↓                              ↓
                    Qdrant Database ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ← ←
```

## 🔄 Expected Workflow Execution

### **1. Document Processing Flow**
When documents are uploaded:
```
1. User uploads documents via any interface
2. Gradio/FastAPI initiates DocumentProcessingWorkflow via Temporal
3. Temporal orchestrates:
   - Text chunking (in temporal_service)
   - Embedding generation (embedding_service activities)
   - Vector indexing (retriever_service activities)
4. All operations are durable, retryable, and observable via Temporal UI
```

### **2. Query/Retrieval Flow**
When users ask questions:
```
1. User submits query via Gradio chat interface
2. Gradio calls get_context_via_temporal() → Temporal Client
3. Temporal starts RetrievalWorkflow
4. RetrievalWorkflow orchestrates:
   - Query embedding (embedding_service)
   - Vector similarity search (retriever_service)
   - Result ranking and formatting
5. Context returns to Gradio → OpenAI API → Streaming response
```

## 🎛️ Services & Ports After Complete Deployment

| Service | Port | Purpose | Status |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| **Gradio UI** | 7860 | User chat interface | ✅ Temporal-enabled |
| **FastAPI** | 8000 | REST API (legacy) | ⚠️ Mixed (some endpoints still HTTP) |
| **Retriever Service** | 8001 | Vector search activities | ✅ Temporal activities |
| **Embedding Service** | 8002 | Text embedding activities | ✅ Temporal activities |
| **Temporal API** | 8003 | Workflow initiation | ✅ New orchestrator |
| **Temporal Server** | 7233 | Workflow engine | ✅ Core orchestrator |
| **Temporal UI** | 8081 | Workflow monitoring | ✅ Observability |
| **Qdrant** | 6333 | Vector database | ✅ Storage layer |
| **PostgreSQL** | 5432 | Temporal persistence | ✅ Workflow state |

## 🧪 Testing the Complete System

### **1. Start the Complete Stack**
```bash
# From project root
docker-compose up -d

# Verify all services are running
docker-compose ps
```

### **2. Expected Service Health**
All services should show healthy status:
- ✅ Temporal server running and connected to PostgreSQL
- ✅ Temporal workers registered and listening for tasks
- ✅ Embedding/Retriever services running as Temporal workers
- ✅ Gradio UI accessible and connected to Temporal
- ✅ Qdrant vector database operational

### **3. End-to-End Workflow Test**
```bash
# Test document processing (should use Temporal)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8003/process-documents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"documents": [{"text": "Test document", "source": "test.txt"}]}'

# Test retrieval via Gradio (should use Temporal)
# Open http://localhost:7860 and submit a query
```

### **4. Temporal UI Monitoring**
- Open http://localhost:8081
- Should see workflows executing: `DocumentProcessingWorkflow`, `RetrievalWorkflow`
- Activity history showing embedding and retrieval operations
- No failed workflows (all retries handled gracefully)

## 📊 Expected Performance Improvements

### **Reliability**
- ✅ **Durable execution**: Workflows survive service restarts
- ✅ **Automatic retries**: Failed activities retry with exponential backoff
- ✅ **Exactly-once semantics**: No duplicate processing

### **Observability**
- ✅ **Workflow history**: Complete audit trail in Temporal UI
- ✅ **Activity monitoring**: Real-time progress tracking
- ✅ **Error visibility**: Clear error messages and stack traces

### **Scalability**
- ✅ **Horizontal scaling**: Multiple workers can handle same task queues
- ✅ **Load balancing**: Temporal distributes work across available workers
- ✅ **Resource isolation**: Each service scales independently

## 🔍 What Changed vs. What Stayed

### **Changed (Now Temporal-based)**
- ✅ **Gradio retrieval**: Uses `get_context_via_temporal()` instead of HTTP
- ✅ **Document processing**: Orchestrated via `DocumentProcessingWorkflow`
- ✅ **Service coordination**: All managed through Temporal workflows
- ✅ **Error handling**: Temporal's built-in retry and recovery mechanisms

### **Unchanged (Still HTTP-based)**
- ⚠️ **FastAPI endpoints**: Legacy REST API still exists (for backward compatibility)
- ⚠️ **Gradio monitoring**: Cache status and service health checks still use HTTP
- ⚠️ **Direct API access**: Users can still call services directly if needed

## 🎯 Key Success Indicators

### **1. Workflow Execution**
- Temporal UI shows successful workflow completions
- No stuck or failed workflows
- Activity retries working properly

### **2. User Experience**
- Gradio chat interface works normally
- Response times similar or better than before
- No visible changes to user-facing functionality

### **3. System Resilience**
- Services can restart without losing workflow state
- Failed activities automatically retry
- Network issues don't cause permanent failures

## 🚨 Potential Issues & Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**
1. **Temporal connection failures**: Check if Temporal server is running
2. **Worker registration issues**: Verify task queue names match
3. **Database connectivity**: Ensure PostgreSQL is accessible
4. **Port conflicts**: Check if all required ports are available

### **Debugging Steps**
1. Check Temporal UI for workflow status
2. Review service logs for connection errors
3. Verify environment variables are set correctly
4. Test individual services before full integration

## 🎉 What This Accomplishes

The completed refactoring achieves:

1. **Unified Orchestration**: All complex operations managed by Temporal
2. **Better Reliability**: Automatic retries, durable execution, exactly-once processing
3. **Enhanced Observability**: Complete workflow visibility and monitoring
4. **Improved Scalability**: Services can scale independently based on load
5. **Maintainable Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns, easier debugging

The system is now production-ready with enterprise-grade workflow orchestration while maintaining all existing functionality!
